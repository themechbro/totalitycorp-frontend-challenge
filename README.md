# totalitycorp-frontend-challenge

This is a assesment from Totality corp. Here I have recreated the Starbucks Home Page using HTML and CSS. Flexbox (CSS) is used mainly to make the contents fit perfectly in  different sizes along with mediaqueries. For Icons I have used a CDN kit from FontAwesome.
